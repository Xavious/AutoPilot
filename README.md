## Quick Start

### Opening the GUI

Type `ap help` or `ap gui` to open the AutoPilot control panel.

The GUI has four main tabs:
- **Status** - View autopilot status, current ship, route, and manifest
- **Ships** - Manage ship templates

### Basic Flight

1. **Set up a ship:**
   - Open GUI (`ap`)
   - Go to **Ships** tab
   - Click **[Add New Ship]**
   - Enter ship name (required)
   - If your ship requires walking to cockpit, add enter/exit paths
   - Click **[Save]**

2. **Fly somewhere:**
   - Command-line: `ap fly tatooine`
   - Or use GUI routes with **[Fly To]** button

### Running Cargo

1. **Create a manifest:**
   - Open GUI → **Manifests** tab
   - Click **[Add New Manifest]**
   - Set a name for your manifest
   - Click **[Add Delivery]**
   - Enter planet and resource
   - Optionally select a route to follow
   - Add more deliveries as needed
   - Click **[Save]**

2. **Start cargo run:**
   - Command-line: `ap start cargo`
   - AutoPilot will loop through deliveries, buying and selling automatically

3. **View profit:**
   - Command-line: `ap profit`

## How It Works

### Flight Automation

AutoPilot monitors game output with triggers that automatically:
1. Launch your ship when you enter cockpit
2. Engage autopilot to destination
3. Wait for hyperspace travel
4. Land on arrival (using preferred pad if set)
5. Exit ship and continue to next waypoint if any

### Cargo Automation

When running cargo with a manifest:
1. AutoPilot visits each delivery in sequence
2. Sells cargo hold contents at destination planet
3. Buys the resource specified for that delivery
4. Flies to next delivery (using specified route or direct)
5. Tracks expenses, revenue, and fuel costs
6. Loops back to first delivery when complete

**Important:** Start cargo runs with an empty cargo hold.

### Routes vs Manifests

- **Routes** - Simple planet waypoint lists for flying only
- **Manifests** - Cargo delivery lists with planet/resource pairs
  - Each delivery can optionally use a route or fly direct
  - Manifests are for cargo automation

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Ship Setup** - Single-seater ships only need a name; larger ships need enter/exit paths
2. **Save Templates** - Create ship/route/manifest templates for quick reuse
3. **Preferred Pads** - Set preferred landing pads for busy planets to avoid queues
4. **Empty Holds** - Always start cargo runs with empty cargo holds
5. **Kill Switch** - Use `ap off` to immediately disable all automation
6. **Profit Tracking** - Run `ap profit` during cargo runs to monitor credits/hour

## Troubleshooting

**AutoPilot not responding?**
- Check if triggers are enabled: `ap status`
- Enable triggers: `ap on`
- Verify ship is loaded: `ap status`

**Ship won't launch/land?**
- Check ship name matches exactly: `ap set ship <name>`
- Verify you're at the correct location (hatch/cockpit)

**Cargo not buying/selling?**
- Ensure manifest is loaded
- Verify cargo hold is empty when starting
- Check resource names match game exactly

**GUI not showing?**
- Type `ap gui` to open
- Check for Mudlet errors in console

## Development

This package is built using [Muddler](https://github.com/demonnic/muddler) development paradigm.

**For Developers:**
- Source code: `/src/` directory
- Main script: `src/scripts/autopilot.script.lua`
- Triggers: `src/triggers/`
- See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for comprehensive development documentation

## Future Enhancements

Potential features being considered:
- Turbolift support for ground navigation
- Enhanced route optimization
- More intuitive first-time setup flow
- Cargo marketplace price tracking
